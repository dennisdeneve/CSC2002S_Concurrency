# CSC2002S_Concurrency
Designing a multithreaded word falling game that avoids the dangers of concurrency and maintaining thread safety to ensure liveliness and correctness in the code.
This GUI interface is a game that pops up when the WordApp.java program is run. 
A window will popup with the relative buttons to ensure for a user-friendly game where the words are falling down on the screen.

This concurrent implementation uses various synchronization methods to maintain thread safety, namely atomic variables etc.
