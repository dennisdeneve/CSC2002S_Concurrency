This GUI interface is a game that pops up when the WordApp.java program is run. 
A window will popup with the relative buttons to ensure for a user-friendly game where the words are falling down on the screen.

The missed counter only updates once the next word has been 'caught' by the user. I am unsure as to why this is the case, one hunch is that it may be due to the non-deterministic nature of threads in general. Multiple threads are used in the duration of the game.
